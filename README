# Django Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio website built with Django that showcases my skills, projects, and professional background. The website includes a contact form that allows visitors to send messages, with their data stored in a database for easy access and management.

## Features

- **Contact Form**: Allows visitors to submit their name, email, phone number, and message.
- **Database Integration**: All form submissions are stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and management.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
